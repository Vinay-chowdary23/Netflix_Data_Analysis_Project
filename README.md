## Netflix Data Analysis Project

This is my first data analysis project where I explored the Netflix dataset from Kaggle.
The main goal was to analyze Netflix content, find patterns, and visualize trends such as which countries produce the most content and how releases have changed over the years.
This project helped me improve my Python, data cleaning, and data visualization skills.

## Dataset

File name: netflix_titles.csv

Description: The dataset includes details about Movies and TV Shows available on Netflix such as title, director, country, release year, and genres.

Source: [Netflix Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)

## Project Objectives

❖ Load and clean the dataset (handle missing values)

❖ Compare Movies vs TV Shows

❖ Find which country has the most Netflix titles

❖ Identify the most common genres/categories

❖ Visualize the yearly release trend and top countries

## Tools & Libraries Used

✦ Python

✦ Pandas

✦ NumPy

✦ Matplotlib

✦ Seaborn

## Visual Outputs

All the output images are saved inside the [v_Outputs](./v_Outputs) folder.
They show the key results from the analysis:

Exploration(Output).png – initial data exploration and summary.

Trend and Top Countries(Output).png – shows yearly release trends and top countries.

Line plot.png – number of Netflix titles released each year.

Bar plot.png – top 10 countries with the most Netflix titles.

## Key Findings

The United States has the highest number of titles on Netflix.

India and the UK are among the next top contributors.

Netflix’s content grew rapidly after 2015.

Movies are more common than TV Shows overall.
